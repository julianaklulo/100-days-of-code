# 100 Days Of Code Log - Round 1 - Juliana Karoline (@julianaklulo)

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. 

### Day 1: March 31, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the mobile part of Rocketseat's Semana OmniStack 11 project.

**Thoughts:** I never thought I would enjoy working with frontend. I'm excited to learn more
on creating SPAs and combining React with Python.
