# 100 Days Of Code Log - Round 1 - Juliana Karoline (@julianaklulo)

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. 

### Day 1: March 31, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the mobile part of Rocketseat's Semana OmniStack 11 project.

**Thoughts:** I never thought I would enjoy working with frontend. I'm excited to learn more
on creating SPAs and combining React with Python.

**Link(s) to work**: [Be The Hero app](https://github.com/julianaklulo/omnistack11/tree/master/mobile)


### Day 2: April 1, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the last part of Semana OmniStack 11 project, adding validation to the API's routes and unit/integration tests.

**Thoughts:** Automated tests are essencial nowadays and I need to practice it. I'll try to read more about TDD and apply it on my next project.
