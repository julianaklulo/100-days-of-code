# 100 Days Of Code Log - Round 1 - Juliana Karoline (@julianaklulo)

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. 

### Day 1: March 31, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the mobile part of Rocketseat's Semana OmniStack 11 project.

**Thoughts**: I never thought I would enjoy working with frontend. I'm excited to learn more
on creating SPAs and combining React with Python.

### Day 2: April 1, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the last part of Semana OmniStack 11 project, adding validation to the API's routes and unit/integration tests.

**Thoughts**: Automated tests are essencial nowadays and I need to practice it. I'll try to read more about TDD and apply it on my next project.

2. [Tests with Jest](https://github.com/julianaklulo/omnistack11/commit/1660dbc6ac4d1e72242251f5cbf4db90062e57c8) 


### Day 3: April 2, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Completed the tic-tac-toe game example available at React's documentation.

**Thoughts**: Now I undestood more about the concept of states and how it is preserved in the components.

### Day 4: April 3, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Started the tutorial at Django's documentation (parts 1, 2 and 3).

**Thoughts**: My first contact with Django was at a Django Girls workshop, which material is focused on introducing web developing to beginners. I enjoyed the oficial tutorial approach better because it shows different ways of achieving the same result, often refactoring the code.

### Day 5: April 4, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tutorial at Django's documentation (parts 4, 5, 6 and 7).

**Thoughts**: I'm gladly found out that one of the parts of the tutorial is focused on writing tests. Once more, I'm setting a reminder for myself to study TDD. The last part showed how to customize the admin site, which I had never done before. I guess that I should continue exploring the documentation, it seems like the best resource to improve my undestanding of Django.

### Day 6: April 5, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Made an Genius-like game using MicroPython on a micro:bit board.

**Thoughts**: I have a few boards that run MicroPython, it is quite fun to play with them. I have some unfinished IoT projects that I need to get back to.

### Day 7: April 6, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Solved the Warm Up Challenges on the Interview Preparation Kit available at Hackerrank.

**Thoughts**: It has been a while since the last time I've solved these kind of logic challenges. Hackerrank accepts solutions written in Python, so I'm using it to improve my problem solving skills.

### Day 8: April 7, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Solved some of the Arrays Challenges on the Interview Preparation Kit available at Hackerrank.

**Thoughts**: I got stuck on a problem, analysing one of the test cases I found a bug in my solution and realized that it only works in some cases. I'll try to get back to it tomorrow.

### Day 9: April 8, 2020.

**Today's Progress**: Attended an online coding dojo.

**Thoughts**: My mic didn't work, so I couldn't participate as pilot or copilot ): But I watched it and followed the solution of the problem. I have to buy a new microphone to be sure to participate in the next one.
